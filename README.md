# ERA1_Session5 Repo
This repo has following 3 files to train a MNIST hand written digit classifier model using MNIST pytorch dataset.
- model.py
- utils.py
- S5.ipynb

## Model.py
This file defines a python class called NET that defines the architecture of the neural network model. 

## utils.py
This file defines the functions for training and testing the neural network model. It also has the train_transforms and test_transforms that converts the input batch of images into model input ready format.

## S5.ipynb
This is the main jupyter notebook that will train the MNIST digit classifier model using the above two files along with pytorch library functions.
